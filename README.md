Sandbox repo to learn and practise GitHub Pages.

## Obsidian as editor
I have now cloned this repo to my computer. Then opened the folder as a vault in Obsidian, where I can edit the files. I have added a Git plugin to Obsidian so I can pull/push changes from/to the repo from within Obsidian. This way I can quickly publish changes directly from Obsidian to the live GitHub Pages site.
